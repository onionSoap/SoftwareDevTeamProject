Meeting 11/17/2024 @ 8pm
Attendees: Emily, Sofia, Leo
Excused:
Did not attend: Dorjee, Carter

What has been completed?
Emily: Wrote three post requests, two/three working but one seems to not work properly (failing a test). Will t/s that. But the other two work properly.
Leo: Experimenting with hovering over an item and it indicating it can be clicked.
Sofia: Items are pickup-able, active items can solve puzzles, function "load_items" completed, active listener that checks for if the active item is correct, created disctionaries and arrays

What is still in progress?
Emily: Posts written but tests for some failing, need to t/s that. Also need to update insert.sql to have all items and puzzles.
Leo: Hovering item mechanic.
Sofia: Merge all working parts into main.

What will be our deliverables by Tuesday's meeting?
Emily: All game-necessary post requests completed (with passing tests for each), insert.sql fully updated with items and puzzles
Leo: Hover item mechanic.
Sofia: Everything listen in completed. 

Future thoughts:
Emily: Integration of all moving parts, all completed and working mechanics pushed to main so that we can access them for testing, don't forget to update the Projects
Leo: Whatever the team needs done, will work with Sofia to figure out other game mechanics to implement (empty functions that we know we need to do but haven't implemented yet).
Sofia: How do we store these variables that show what items are showing or not. Look into user session and see if it can be stored there.
